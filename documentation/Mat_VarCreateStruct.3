.Dt MAT_VARCREATESTRUCT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm Mat_VarCreateStruct
.Nd Creates a structure variable.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <matio.h>
.Ft matvar_t *
.Fo Mat_VarCreateStruct
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fa "int rank"
.Fa "size_t *dims"
.Fa "const char **fields"
.Fa "unsigned nfields"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn Mat_VarCreateStruct
function creates a structure variable named
.Fa name
that can be written to a MAT file.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the structure variable was successfully created, a pointer to the variable
is returned. Otherwise NULL is returned. The structure variable pointer should
be free'd when no longer needed using
.Xr Mat_VarFree 3
\. The names of the fields are copied in the function, and thus should be released
after calling the function if necessary.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example program opens a MAT file named by the first argument to the
program, and writes a structure named
.Em a
to the file.
.Bd -literal
#include "matio.h"

    field = Mat_VarCreate(NULL,MAT_C_DOUBLE,MAT_T_DOUBLE,2,dims,&data1,
                MAT_F_DONT_COPY_DATA);
    Mat_VarSetStructFieldByName(matvar, "field1", 0, field);

    field = Mat_VarCreate(NULL,MAT_C_DOUBLE,MAT_T_DOUBLE,2,dims,&data2,
                MAT_F_DONT_COPY_DATA);
    Mat_VarSetStructFieldByName(matvar, "field2", 0, field);
