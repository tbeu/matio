Bug Fixes in 1.3.0 (30 June 2006)
* WriteCompressedData did not initialize the data tag (data_tag variable)

  padding bytes. Correct implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte
  integer.
* Write5 wrote the array name tag as a 2 byte integer followed by 2
  padding bytes when the name was more than 4 characters. Correct
  implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte integer.
* Write5 had a hard-coded uncompressed variable size of 448 when writing
  compressed data.
* WriteInfo5 wrote the array name tag as a 2 byte integer followed by 2
  padding bytes when the name was more than 4 characters. Correct
  implementation writes the array name tag as a 4 byte integer.
* Mat_Create wrote the endian sequence incorrectly.
* Mat_VarCreate set the number of bytes incorrectly for structures.

  allow for multi-byte characters.

  not support these types, other free software does.
* Writing compressed variables is supported for numeric arrays. Future versions
  will implement character, sparse, cell, and structure arrays.
* A Fortran 90/95 interface has been incorporated. Not all functions are
  implemented yet, but more will come and it is at least functional now.
  Hopefully feedback will help guide the Fortran interface development.
* Replaced preprocessor defines for types, classes, etc. with enum's.
Bug Fixes in 1.1.4 (9 January 2006)
* Mat_VarReadData did not handle complex data.
