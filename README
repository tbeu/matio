1.0 Introduction
    Matio is an open-source C library for reading and writing binary MATLAB MAT
    files.
    This library is designed for use by programs/libraries that do not have
    access or do not want to rely on MATLAB's shared libraries.

        Bugs, enhancements, etc. should be submitted using one of the trackers
        on the sourceforge page (http://sourceforge.net/p/matio/_list/tickets).

2.0 Building
    This section describes how to build matio. Section 2.1 describes the
    dependencies, Section 2.2 how to build/test matio, and Section 2.3
    documents the platforms matio has been tested on.

    2.1 Dependencies
        Matio has two optional dependencies. These are not required for the
        software to work, but without them some files may be unreadable. Zlib
        is required to read/write level 5 MAT files that use compression. HDF5
        is required to work with newer MAT files that use the HDF5-format
        files.

        2.1.1 zlib
            To support compressed MAT files, zlib 1.2.3 or greater is required.
            The zlib software can be downloaded from http://zlib.net.

        2.1.2 HDF5
            Support for MAT file version 7.3 requires the HDF5 library. This
            library can be downloaded from https://www.hdfgroup.org/. Matio
            requires HDF5 version 1.8.x or greater. Neither deprecated HDF5
            1.6.x API functions nor HDF5 higher-level functions are called.

              * Building matio with HDF5 1.8.x requires configuration of HDF5
                with default API version 1.8 (i.e.
                '--with-default-api-version=v18').
              * Building matio with HDF5 1.10.x requires configuration of HDF5
                with either default API version 1.10 (i.e.
                '--with-default-api-version=v110') or with deprecated API
                version 1.8 (i.e. '--with-default-api-version=v18').


            For Windows, the pre-compiled binaries can be used which also
            include a DLL of zlib to satisfy the zlib dependency.

    2.2 Building matio
        2.2.1 Quick Build Guide
            The primary method for building the software is using 'configure'
            followed by 'make'. After building, the testsuite can be executed to
            test the software using 'make check'. The software can be installed
            using 'make install'. For example,
                $ tar zxf matio-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
                $ cd matio-X.Y.Z
                $ ./configure
                $ make
                $ make check
                $ make install

            If any of the tests in the testsuite fail, you should report the failure
            using the tracker (see Section 1.4). You should attach the generated
            testsuite.log file to the bug report.

        2.2.2 Configure Options
            The configure script used to build the software takes a number of
            options. This section describes the key options.

              * '--enable-mat73=yes'
                  This flag en/disables the support for version 7.3 MAT files.
                  The option only makes sense if built with HDF5 as support for
                  version 7.3 files. It will be disabled if HDF5 is not
                  available.
              * '--enable-extended-sparse=yes'
                  Enable extended sparse matrix data types not supported in
                  MATLAB. MATLAB only supports double-precision sparse data.
                  With this flag, matio will read sparse data with other types
                  (i.e. single-precision and integer types).
              * '--with-matlab=DIR'
                  This option specifies the directory (DIR) with the 'matlab'
                  program. With this option, the testsuite will check that the
                  MAT files written by matio can be read into MATLAB. Without
                  this, the test will only check that matio can read the file
                  written and if successful the test will be skipped. If matio
                  can not read the file, the test will fail.
              * '--with-zlib=DIR'
                  This option specifies the prefix where zlib is installed
                  (see Section 2.1.1 for information about zlib).
              * '--with-hdf5=DIR'
                  This option specifies the prefix where the HDF5 software is
                  installed (see Section 2.1.2 for information about HDF5).
              * '--with-default-file-ver=version'
                  This option sets the default MAT file version (4,5,7.3) that
                  will be used when writing. The default file version is used
                  by the Mat_Create macro and the Mat_CreateVer function when
                  MAT_FT_DEFAULT is used for the version argument.
              * '--with-libdir-suffix=suffix'
                  This option specifies a suffix to apply to library
                  directories when installing and looking for dependent
                  libraries (i.e. HDF5 and zlib). For example, some multi-arch
                  Linux distributions install 64-bit libraries into lib64 and
                  32-bit libraries into lib.

        2.2.3 Visual Studio
            Visual Studio solutions are provided as visual_studio/matio_vs2008.sln
            for VS2008 and as visual_studio/matio.sln for VS2010 (and newer).
            The solutions are set up to build a DLL of the matio library
            (libmatio.dll) and matdump tool and assume HDF5 is available in the
            directory specified by the HDF5_DIR environment variable. It is
            assumed that the shared libraries of HDF5 (and zlib) are available.
            If the static libraries of HDF5 (and zlib) are installed/built the
            macro 'H5_BUILT_AS_STATIC_LIB' needs to be defined (instead of
            'H5_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB').

        2.2.4 Testsuite
            A testsuite is available when building with the GNU autotools. To
            run the testsuite, first configure and build matio. After building
            run 'make check' to run the testsuite. If matio was built without
            zlib, the compressed variable tests will be skipped. If built
            without HDF5, the tests for version 7.3 MAT files will be skipped.
            If the path to the MATLAB application was not specified
            ('--with-matlab'), the write tests will fail if matio cannot read
            the file and skip if matio can read the file. The write tests will
            pass if MATLAB is available and can also read the file.

            To report matio testsuite failures, compress the testsuite.log file
            in the test sub-directory of the build directory. Upload the
            compressed log file along with a bug report (see Section 1.4 for
            information on reporting bugs).

    2.3 Platforms
        The library has been tested/used on Linux, Windows, OS X, and AIX
        including both little-endian and big-endian architecture.
