1.0 Introduction

Acknowledgements:
    libmatio is an open-source library for reading/writing Matlab MAT files.
    This library is designed for use by programs/libraries that do not have
    access or do not want to rely on Matlab's shared library.

    1.1 Contact
        You can contact me (Christopher Hulbert) through email at
        chulbe1@mac.com

    1.2 Acknowledgements
        The following people/organizations have helped in the development of
        matio through patches, bug reports, and/or testing:
          * Jacco van Beek
          * SGI in support of Interactive Supercomputing, Inc.
          * SciLab
          * Steven Leibman <sleibman@alum.mit.edu>

    1.3 Contributing
        Part of my reason for releasing this software is I have many other
        projects to work on and have many features I would still like to
        implement. If you make changes, I would appreciate your contributions
        and more than likely will include them in future releases. If you are
        interested in collaborations, contact me via email (see Section 1.1).

2.0 Building
        Four of the builds currently supported make use of the GNU autotools,
    and thus you should have them. There is a build script in the top-level
    directory for the four builds including the following supported platforms:
    cygwin, mingw, linux, and solaris. You can of course configure and build
    your own way. A Visual C 7 Solution has been created in the build-vc7
    direcotry and a Visual C 6 workspace in the build-vc6 directory.
    These should be self containing, just open and build. There are multiple
    configurations supported, but I recommend the LIB Release or the
    DLL Release. The build-windows directory contains a batch file to build
    using nmake. This makes it easier to set variables and install the software.
    Doxygen is required to build the documentation. Since not all platforms
    support doxygen (mingw and Visual C come to mind) I have included the API
    documentation in the top-level directory as a pdf.

    2.1 zlib
        To support compressed MAT files, zlib 1.2.3 or greater is required.
        The zlib software can be downloaded from http://zlib.net.

    2.2 HDF5
        Support for MAT file version 7.3 requires the HDF5 library. This
        library can be downloaded from The HDF Group website
        (http://www.hdfgroup.org/). MATIO requires HDF5 version 1.8.x, and must
        be built with default API version 1.8 (i.e.
        '--with-default-api-version=v18').

    2.3 Targets
        The library has been tested/used on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and AIX
        including both little-endian and big-endian architecture.
